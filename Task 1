I have joined the vitual internship of c++ programming from codsoft 
Task 1 :NUMBER GUESSING GAME
Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    srand(time(0));
    int numGuess = rand() % 100 + 1;
    int guess;
    cout << "*Number Guessing Game*\n";
    cout << "Think of a number between 1 and 100."<<endl;
    do {
        cout << "Enter your guess: ";
        cin >> guess;
        if (guess < numGuess) {
            cout << "Low! Try again.\n";
        } else if (guess > numGuess) {
            cout << "High! Try again.\n";
        } else {
            cout << "You won the game."<<endl;
        }
    } while (guess != numGuess);
    return 0;
}
